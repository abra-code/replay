		"  -e, --stop-on-error   Stop executing the remaining playlist actions on first error.\n"
		"  -f, --force        If the file operation fails, delete destination and try again.\n"
		"  -o, --ordered-output  In simple concurrent execution mode preserve the order of printed task outputs as specified\n"
		"                     in the playlist. The tasks are still executed concurrently without order guarantee\n"

		"  -n, --dry-run      Show a log of actions which would be performed without running them.\n"
		"  -v, --verbose      Show a log of actions while they are executed.\n"

		"  A playlist is an array of action steps.\n"
		"  Each step is a dictionary with action type and parameters. See below for actions and examples.\n"

		"Dependency analysis:\n"
		"\n"
		"  In default execution mode (without --serial or --no-dependency option) \"replay\" performs dependency analysis\n"
		"  and constructs an execution graph based on files consumed and produced by actions.\n"
		"  If a file produced by action A is needed by action B, action B will not be executed until action A is finished.\n"
		"  For example: if your playlist contains an action to create a directory and other actions write files\n"
		"  into this directory, all these file actions will wait for directory creation to be finished and then they will\n"
		"  be executed concurrently if otherwise independent from each other.\n"
		"  Concurrent execution imposes a couple of rules on actions:\n"
		"  1. No two actions may produce the same output. With concurrent execution this would produce undeterministic results\n"
		"     depending on which action happened to run first or fail if they accessed the same file for writing concurrently.\n"
		"     \"replay\" will not run any actions when this condition is detected during dependency analysis.\n"
		"  2. Action dependencies must not create a cycle. In other words the dependency graph must be a proper DAG.\n"
		"     An example cycle is one action copying file A to B and another action copying file B to A.\n"
		"     Replay algorithm tracks the number of unsatisifed dependencies for each action. When the number drops to zero,\n"
		"     the action is dispatched for execution. For actions in a cycle that number never drops to zero and they can\n"
		"     never be dispatched. After all dispatched tasks are done \"replay\" verifies all actions in the playlist\n"
		"     were executed and reports a failure if they were not, listing the ones which were skipped.\n"
		"  3. Deletion and creation of the same file or directory in one playlist will result in creation first and\n"
		"     deletion second because the deletion consumes the output of creation. If deletion is a required preparation step\n"
		"     it should be executed in a separate playlist before the main tasks are scheduled. You may pass --playlist-key\n"
		"     multiple times as a parameter and the playlists will be executed one after another in the order specified.\n"
		"  4. Moving or deleting an item makes it unusable for other actions at the original path. Such actions are exclusive\n"
		"     consumers of given input paths and cannot share their inputs with other actions. Producing additional items under\n"
		"     such exclusive input paths is also not allowed. \"replay\" will report an error during dependency analysis\n"
